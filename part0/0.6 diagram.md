<!-- The user enters a new note in the SPA text field and then clicks the "Save" button. The browser sends a POST request to the server to save the note. The server receives the request and saves the note in the database. The server then sends a success response to the browser. Finally, the browser receives the response and shows the user that the note has been saved successfully. -->
